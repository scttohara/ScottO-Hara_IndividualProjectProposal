# ScottO-Hara_IndividualProjectProposal
Project Abstract
	
My project would focus on creating a website to help parents and children communicate about mental health issues, while allowing parents to create appointment, or medication reminders. Additionally, the site would let any child profile play games that might be relaxing and/or educational for user analysis. First, parents would create a profile and answer some questions about their child’s mental health. Next, a child profile would be created from these questions and a link would be sent to the child’s email. When the child follows the link, they will be prompted to answer some hypothetical scenario questions. Their profile will be further personalized based on these answers. Third, the website would allow Parent and Child profiles to create journal entries that would be saved on a database. Finally, the data created by the users, especially the game data, will be used to compare with other users who share similar mental health issues to attempt to identify patterns. This would be done to help with user recommendations. 



Project Relevance
	
The main educational goals this project focuses on are access to a database and multi-threading. This project is made up of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and MongoDB. Additionally, I will use a Linux server running on an old PC in my house. The project will enhance students with those skills. The website would be open-source and stored on GitHub. 

Conceptual Design

My contribution to this project would be getting everything setup and programming all of the pieces. I think at most I would need one partner but would prefer to do all of the programming myself in order to learn the different components of the web app design and database connection procedures. If my project was chosen and I needed to have one or more team members, I would take on more of a project manager role and try to delegate what each member would work on based on their existing skills and what they would prefer to do. I would fill in the gaps in the team’s skills and learn whatever language, or technology, we didn’t have in the group already. Having meetings would be the best way for us to communicate what work we have done and where we stand. In addition, Trello would be used for issue and development tracking. The project will require a large amount of database work, along with front-end development. Finally, it would be stored and possibly hosted through GitHub pages with connect to the MongoDB server in my house.

Background

This will be a new open source project and therefore I have no URL.
